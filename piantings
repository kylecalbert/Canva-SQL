10) Identify the museums which are open on both Sunday and Monday. Display museum name, city.
-- SELECT m.name, m.city
-- FROM museum_hours mh1
-- JOIN museum m ON m.museum_id = mh1.museum_id
-- WHERE mh1.day = 'Sunday'
-- AND EXISTS(
-- 	Select 1 
-- 	FROM museum_hours mh2
-- 	WHERE mh2.museum_id = mh1.museum_id AND mh2.day = 'Monday'
-- )

15) Which museum is open for the longest during a day. Dispay museum name, state and hours open and which day?

select* FROM (SELECT
	mh.museum_id,
	M.state,
	m.name,
	mh.open,
	mh.close,
	mh.day,
	to_timestamp(open, 'HH:MI AM') as open_time,
	to_timestamp(close, 'HH:MI PM') as close_time,
	to_timestamp(close, 'HH:MI PM') - to_timestamp(open, 'HH:MI AM') AS duration,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY (to_timestamp(close, 'HH:MI PM') - to_timestamp(open, 'HH:MI AM'))DESC) AS longest_open_rank
FROM museum_hours mh
JOIN museum m on m.museum_id = mh.museum_id) 
AS ranked_museums
WHERE longest_open_rank = 1


18) Display the country and the city with most no of museums. Output 2 seperate columns to mention the city and country. 
WITH cte_country AS 
	(SELECT country, COUNT(1)
	,RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rnk
	FROM museum
	GROUP BY country),
    cte_city AS
	 (SELECT city, COUNT(1)
	 ,RANK () OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rnk
	 FROM museum
	 GROUP BY city)
SELECT *
	FROM cte_country
CROSS JOIN cte_city
WHERE cte_country.rnk = 1
and cte_city.rnk = 1
